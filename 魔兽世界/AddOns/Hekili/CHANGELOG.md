[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Hekili/hekili/compare/v8.1.5-19-alpha1...v8.1.5-19-alpha2)

- Unholy:  If our ghoul is actively spreading wounds for us, we don't need to.  
- Brewmaster:  Allow user to specify how much overlap is allowed for ISB.  
- Elemental:  Don't multi-dot Flame Shock on targets that'll die too quiclky to matter (1/3 FS duration).  
- Unholy:  Added festermight\_cycle option, which determines where you try to spread some festers around before Death and Decay.  
- Target count fix (didn't impact anyone since max\_ttd wasn't used anywhere yet).
