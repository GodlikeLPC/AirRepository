# Changelog

## Changed in v4.0.18c
* Classic-compatible version released. Somewhat incomplete set of rares, because a lot of the higher level zones had poor data available on wowhead at the moment.

## Changed in v4.0.17
* Added questids for most Mechagon and Nazjatar rares
* Added some missing Nazjatar rares

## Changed in v4.0.1

* Quite a few new cataclysm rares included in the data; reimport to pick them up
* Disabling the rare popup wasn't working
